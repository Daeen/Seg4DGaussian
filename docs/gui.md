# Tutorial on GUI

## Running the Standalone GUI script
The standalone GUI script provides the same features as the normal GUI. We provide some [example scenes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IJzM_lxizajQqQ0f_Hiu_IdpaRdeg1KJ/view?usp=sharing) to play with. 
```
### Running the standalone GUI (first download the demos.zip above and and uncompress in ./assets/)
python gui_standalone.py -m assets/demos/<split-cookie/as_novel_view/sear_steak> --iteration 30000
```
As the standalone GUI doesn't have information regarding the length (in second) of the dynamic scene, this needs to be configured per scene in the GUI with the slider ```Duration (sec)``` (Default: 10 seconds). For detailed functionalities of the GUI, please see the following sections. 
 
## Running the GUI script

```
python gui_sadg.py -m output/<DATASET>/<NAME> --load_mask_on_the_fly --load_image_on_the_fly --eval --load2gpu_on_the_fly --iteration 30000
```

## Changing Different Rendering Mode

- You can use the cursor to drag to different novel views in the GUI
- Scroll to adjust the FoV
- Select different rendering modes ( `Render, Rendered Features, Gaussian Features, Gaussian Clusters, Segmentation, Point Cloud, Depth` ) in the combo box
- Please make sure to run `Clustering` before rendering the in `Gaussian Clusters, Segmentation` mode

## Click Prompt

- Make sure you run `Clustering` beforehand
- Drag the slider of `Freeze Time` to change to different time
- Hold the key `A` and `Left-Click` on the object of interest in the novel view
- Hold the key `D` and `Left-Click` to deselect the click
- Drag the slider of `Score Threshold` to adjust the threshold for filtering unwanted Gaussians

## Text Prompt

- Make sure you run `Clustering` beforehand
- Enter the text prompt and click `Enter`
- Click `Remove Object` to toggle the visibility of the selected objects (selected / removal)

## Other Buttons

- You can change to different clustering methods in the combo box (DBSCAN / K-Means)
- `Render Mask` renders transparant segmentation mask on the rendering
- `Save Object` saves the current visible Gaussians (for later composition with other scenes)
- `Render Object` renders to the test camera views
